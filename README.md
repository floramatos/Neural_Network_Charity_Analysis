# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Data --- CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Columns that capture metadata about each organization:
	EIN and NAME—Identification columns
	APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
	AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
	CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
	USE_CASE—Use case for funding
	ORGANIZATION—Organization type
	STATUS—Active status
	INCOME_AMT—Income classification
	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
	ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
	IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

## Results

### Data Preprocessing for Neural Network Model

### Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. 

n_input X n_neurons + n_bias=3520

### Model Optimization
optimize your model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%
